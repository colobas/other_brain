# General Mission
Understand and predict cell behaviours

# Current project

- Stem cell state space
  - Take data from cells at different stages, or that have been perturbed, or are
  differentiating
  - Data can be genomic, imaging, [phenotype](20201206114032-phenotype) 
  - Interpret this data as a manifestation of the cell's (latent? lower-dimensional?) state-space
- Determine the mechanisms by which cells transition from state to state
- Determine how the expression of a subset of genes produces key cellular states

# Methods

- Measuring gene expression in individual cells
- Live imaging cell substructures (organelles)
- Studying hiPS cells
  - Because they are diploid (contain two copies of each chromossome) & propagate in vitro
  - Can be induced to differentiate to many other types of cells
