# A Random Physicist Takes on Economics

- Conventional economics models fail to predict things
- "Curves don't go through data"
    - Overly complicated for the amount prediction errors
    - Scope conditions / validity of the models should be better defined

- Rationality
    - Uniformly distributed agents (on the opportunity set) behave (on avg.) like
      rational agents: another plausbile explanation for supply-demand observations.
        - "Utility (&#x2026;) makes you think in terms of trade-offs; if you are at an optimum,
          deviating from it is less than optimal and encourages zero-sum thinking. Looking
          at the effects of supply and demand as simply the most likely observed state has
          no such consequences. Policies that cause the economy to deviate from the optimum
          seem bad; policies that cause the economy to deviate from the most likely
          outcome may be good or bad"
    - "Rationality" and other features may simply arrise from the opportunity set,
      rather than from the agens exploring it.
