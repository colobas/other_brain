# The majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections likely occur within households and other residential settings

-   Most individuals live with other people
-   Household contact provides plenty opportunity for spreading
-   Household contact is a major driver is a key driver of transmission for other
    respiratory viruses
-   In South-korea study, household contacts were more than six times more likely
    to generate infection than other close contacts <sup id="2ac7f0f6e6719776ed4116530e077294"><a href="#Bi2020" title="Qifang Bi, Yongsheng Wu, Shujiang Mei, Chenfei Ye, Xuan Zou, Zhen Zhang, Xiaojian Liu, Lan Wei, Shaun A Truelove, Tong Zhang, Wei Gao, Cong Cheng, Xiujuan Tang, Xiaoliang Wu, Yu Wu, Binbin Sun, Suli Huang, Yu Sun, Juncen Zhang, Ting Ma, Justin Lessler \&amp; Tiejian Feng, Epidemiology and transmission of {COVID}-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study, {The Lancet Infectious Diseases}, v(8), 911--919 (2020).">Bi2020</a></sup>


## There is still considerable heterogeneity in the type of contact that generates most spreads

-   Spouses of index cases are more than twice as likely to be infected as other
    adult household members <sup id="d8f1f153b83a94423a25e7c93a21fb7c"><a href="#Madewell2020" title="Zachary Madewell, Yang Yang, Ira Longini, Elizabeth Halloran \&amp; Natalie Dean, Household transmission of {SARS}-{CoV}-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary attack rate, v(), (2020).">Madewell2020</a></sup>
-   Older age is associated with increased susceptibility, transmission and
    severity of disease
-   Younger children may be less susceptible and contagious


## Other residential scenarios like prisons and nursery homes also promote long-duration close contact

And for that reason they are also prominent scenarios of transmission. Outbreaks
are particularly bad in these settings. Examples:

-   66% of residents of a homeless shelter infected
-   62% in a nursing home
-   80% in a prison dorm

Even if residents don&rsquo;t leave, these communities are still connected to the
outside world by workers and guests.


# So most frequent transmission scenario is household/residential, but community transmission connects these settings

-   It is responsible for **sustaining** the epidemic, even if few cases are
    directly originated in community transmission
-   Much more variability of possible contacts in community transmission. Hard to
    measure the properties of community transmission


## Crucial factor in community transmission: asymptomatic individuals can transmit the disease

-   Infectiousness may peak before symptom onset, even if viral load is similar in
    symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals
    -   A person without symptoms will take less precautions. Because of this,
        asymptomatic people have the potential to be super-spreaders.
-   Some settings are &ldquo;transmission-amplifying&rdquo;: they promote multiple subsequent
    transmissions. E.g.: I infect one person in my workplace; that person infects
    another person in the same workplace, and so on.


# [Overdispersion in transmission](20201030042927-overdispersion_in_transmission.md)

-   It has been found that for some COVID-19 super-spreading events, 80% of new
    infections were caused by 10% of infected people.


# Modes of transmission

-   For household transmission, it basically doesn&rsquo;t matter what the most prominent
    mode of transmission is, because all modes have a lot of opportunity to drive
    the spread
-   For community transmission, it is more important because it affects policy.
    Also, here there is a greater variety in the nature of infectious contacts.
    However, because the relative contributions of each mode of transmission are
    highly affected by environmental conditions, and so one mode of transmission
    can be prominent in one scenario of community transmission, but irrelevant in
    another scenario


# Networks produced by overdispersed pathogens have &ldquo;scale-free&rdquo; properties


# Effect of interventions in overdispersed scenarios

-   Broad and untargeted interventions may be less effective than expected and
    interventions aimed at super-spreading settings may have a bigger impact.
    However, not all factors that induce overdispersion are amenable to being
    targeted (but some are, like occupation of spaces).


# Interventions at a household level may be highly effective even if imperfect

-   Because they affect the vast majority of transmission events


# On the flip side, in larger spatial scales,

Control measures must be widely and very efficiently implemented so as to be
effective.
