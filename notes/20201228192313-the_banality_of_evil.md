[Hannah Arendt](20201228192327-hannah_arendt)

- The vacuum of political action in everyday life, disenfranchises people because
it removes them from an important part of exercizing and expressing their identity
- This vacuum arises from the fact that enlightenment reduced politics to reasoning
about economics and labour, the supposed objective and rationalizable components
of public policy
- Hannah Arendt says that everyday people are (unknowingly) urging for something
to fill this void of political action and identity, which makes them susceptible
to being coopted by a totalitarian movement
- Hence the phrase "the banality of evil": the banality comes from the fact that
it doesn't take a bad person to advance the interests of a totalitarian movement;
it only takes a "politically empty" person, which in modernity is most people.
Capitalism and enlightenment-style thinking have politically emptied people by
reducing them to cogs in the economic machine, and making them see themselves as
such.
- Example: Eichmann in Jerusalem. Eichmann wasn't an evil genius. He was a rather
average guy, more preocupied with advancing his career than with the atrocities
he was responsible for.
