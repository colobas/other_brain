This is a braindump I made while listening to Philosophize This,
specifically the episodes on the Frankfurt School. If you don't know
Philosophize This, you should really check it out.

# Nietzsche: 'God is dead'

Where does meaning come from now?

Most people won't spend their time philosophizing and figuring this
out for themselves. They'll most probably "inherit" whatever answer
is most culturally accepted in their social context.

# Ideology is replacing religion today

# Why didn't Marx's dialectical prophecies become true?

- The exploited class didn't overthrow the exploiting class.
- Soviet Republic became authoritarian.
- Some thinkers (including the Frankfurt School) answer:
    - Marx's theory doesn't talk enough about the concept of personal liberty, and
    doesn't spend enough time considering the individual

# Frankfurt school

How was it possible for the world to undergo such a technological progress
and still develop the conditions that lead to WW2?


## Critiques of capitalism


- Economics not enough to explain history. Individual psychology is needed
- What if the exploited class doesn't feel exploited?
    - Class consciousness

## Critique of Enlightenment-style thinking:

We use reason to arrive at knowledge, it's anthropocentric - we
want knowledge that is useful to us (even if we don't notice or
acknowledge it)

1.  This has a big impact on the type of questions we ask
2.  When we reason about human behaviour, we do it so that we can act upon it, control it.


The type of reason human beings are able to carry out is always
going to be corrupted with the purpose of controlling whatever it
is we're reasoning about. So there's huge cognitive bias that goes
into that - we make questions in which terms we know how to think
about, and that limits the scope of our theories. It's ridden with
confirmation bias - we fit the object to a theory that describes
the object in a way that enables us to control the object.


# Critique of Western society

Marcuse says this is what western society has become: you're born
as a worker-consumer. your work becomes your identity. You are
what you do and what you consume in your free time. You have to
want to consume enough that you feel the need to go to work for
what you consume the following day.

## Life is not an end in itself

Forced altruism - you have to go do stuff that other people need, else you starve to death.

Because almost no-one wants to be an outcast, you end up
conforming and perpetuating the system

Marcuse concedes: Society is in fact advancing technologically.
But is it advancing as a species? Is the next iPhone 12 more
important than the lives of the people working on the factories
that produce it, that throw themselves off the roof? The system
works if its end is said technological advancement. But in
exchange for what?

# Change

Cold turkey change is impossible. People have to be made aware of
the downsides of the system they have been conditioned to conform
to and perpetuate. Made aware of their chains. Made aware of the
suffering of the people that make this system possible

# Alienation

Why is the worker of the 20th century so alienated, given all this
new technological progress? Everything is a product, and aids in
this alienation

The competition and hyper-efficiency nature of capitalism is the
engine of this alienation

# Fulfillment

The work-consume loop that western life has become, imposes huge
constraints on what people can become. We're not 100% free to
choose whatever we want to consume: we can only consume from that
which is available - limited freedom. And since in this society
our identity is tightly coupled to what we consume, we have very
limited freedom with respect to what we can become.

Workers in the west aren't using their leisure time to become more
aware of their condition. They're using it to relax and rest from
work. They want to be entertained. This creates a demand for
entertainment-as-a-product.
    
What happens when art becomes a product? When art is made to meet
a demand. Then it stops fulfilling its purpose of making people
think, and starts being another mechanism for the perpetuation of
the system. Note that there isn't necessarily an intention here -
it's the nature of the system itself that is self-perpetuating.

In this society you're made to believe that every problem can be
solved by buying the right product. Advertisement industry
realizes this. And they know one problem of contemporary human
existence is the one of craving human interaction, so they'll
create products that can be perceived as the solution for that
problem.
