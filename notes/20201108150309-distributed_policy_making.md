# Is there a way to organize extremely efficient grassroots initiatives?

## Using data / simulations / cellular-automata to come-up with strategies


### Optimal action recommendation

Too much effort lowers the participation level; too little effort lowers the
impact. What is the optimal balance between small action vs big impact?

- Critical mass / Snowball effect
    - How many people does a movement require to be effective?
-Simple behavioural changes can create potentially very large-scale effects (cellular automata / simulations)
    - "If we all did X we could accomplish Y in Z time"


### Smart & distributed protests/movements/unions

- Extremely organized and efficient
- Decentralization & fault-tolerance
- Federated networks of movement members
