- self help ideas with a new face, that ring new but are just standard insights
from religion and philosophy
  - "life is suffering, indulgence and superficial happiness aren't enough"
  - "stand up straight"
- peterson is a talented and assertive public speaker, and using these ideas is
able to captivate a large base
- he has some valid criticisms of the "modern left"
- however, these ideas are a trojan horse for peterson's reactionary world-view
- "post-modern neo marxism", a peterson-coined expression that is basically the same
as "cultural marxism" or "cultural bolshevism", and whose subscribers basically
believe there exists a social movement whose goal is to dismantle western society
  - in response to an interviewer saying "surely you can't compare mao to a
  transgender activist", peterson said "why not? the philosphy underlying their
  utterances is the same."
