# Cell states beyond transcriptomics

- Co-analysis of RNA abundance and sarcomere organization
- Predict subcellular organization states from gene expression

## Background

- Different cells have different intracellular organization (e.g. neurons vs muscle cells)
  - Even within same cell types, different cells can have very different intracellular organization

- RNA <-> Protein abundance connection is well-established
- RNA <-> functional organization not so much: goal of this work
