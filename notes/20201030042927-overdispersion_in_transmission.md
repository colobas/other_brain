# Overdispersion

There is more variation in transmission than that expected by the models.

We normally hear about the R0 value for the epidemic, which is the expected
average number of infections that an infected person will generate (if the
pandemic is &ldquo;left alone&rdquo;). Rt is a similar value, computed for the &ldquo;updated&rdquo;
situation, where measures are taken, and is used as a way to measure whether
if the measures are being effective. Both these numbers are expected
**averages**, which assume that transmissions are &ldquo;evenly distributed&rdquo; i.e.,
that an infected individual generates roughly that number of new infections.
However, there can be huge variability in transmission, meaning that one
person might infect few people, and another person might infect lots of people.

This excess of variability in the number of infections caused by an infected
individual is refered to as &ldquo;overdispersion in transmission&rdquo;, and a prevalence
of this effect essentially translates into the fact that **few people are causing most of the infections**

Differences in viral load, social interactions, amount of coughing, severeness
of symptoms, and many other factors, all affect the number of new infections that
an infected individual generates
