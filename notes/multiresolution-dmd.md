Multi-resolution Dynamic Mode Decomposition is a simple yet very clever extension
of the Vanilla Dynamic Mode Decomposition, about which I wrote on another post

I wrote it while learning about the topic, so it's mostly for myself.
For a much better explanation, please check:

# 

DMD allows us to find the linear dynamical system that best describes
the data we have at hand. I.e., it finds a matrix \\(A\\) that turns
\\(\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax\\) into a good approximation of the system where our
data comes from.


## 

This in turn allows us to write down our system as a combination of
eigenfunctions and DMD modes:


### 

\begin{align\*}
x\_t = \sum\_{k=1}^{M} \phi\_k e^{\omega\_k t} b\_k
\end{align\*}


## 

The idea of multi-resolution DMD starts with separating that sum into
&ldquo;slow modes&rdquo; and &ldquo;fast modes&rdquo;. These are distinguished by their
frequencies \\(\omega\_k\\). So we rewrite the above as:


### 

\begin{align\*}
x\_t = \underbrace{\sum\_{k=1}^{m\_1} \phi\_k e^{\omega\_k t} b\_k
}\_{\hbox{slow modes}} +
\underbrace{
\sum\_{k=m\_1+1}^{M} \phi\_k e^{\omega\_k t} b\_k
}\_{\hbox{fast modes}}
\end{align\*}


### 

The threshold for what is considered a slow mode versus a fast mode is
obviously tunable. One sensible thing to do is to look at the singular
values and how they distribute about the origin, define a maximum radius
and divide the modes according to what singular values lie inside or
outside the radius.


### 

After distinguishing the slow and fast modes, we subtract the slow modes
from the data and we split the data in 2. Now we apply the previous
procedure on each of the chunks. At the end we split each of the chunks
in 2, and so on.


### 

After going as deep as we want in this hierarchy, we can rewrite the
system as:

\begin{align\*}
x\_t = \sum\_{L}^{l=1}\sum\_{J}^{j=1}\sum\_{m\_L}^{k=1}
f\_{l,j}(t) b\_k^{(l,j)}  \phi\_k^{(l,j)}(\xi) \exp(\omega\_k^{(l,j)} t)
\end{align\*}

1.  Where:

    -   \\(f\_{l,j}(t)\\) is a &ldquo;switch&rdquo; that is on when \\(t \in [t\_j, t\_{j+1}]\\)
    -   \\(l = 1,2,...,L\\) is the decomposition level (\\(L\\) is the deepest level)
    -   \\(j = 1,2,...,J\\) is the number of subdivisions per decomposition level
        (\\(J = 2^{(l-1)}\\) since we&rsquo;re always splitting in two)
    -   \\(k = 1,2,...,m\_L\\) is the mode index (\\(m\_L\\) is the max mode index at
        level \\(L\\))
    -   \\(\xi\\) are the spatial coordinates


### 

This basically allows us to have a local system per \\((l,j)\\):

\begin{align\*}
\frac{dx^{(l,j)}}{dt} = A^{(l,j)} x^{(l,j)}
\end{align\*}
